#Hi, I would like to introduce my filetranslater app, based on python.

Here is my plan:
1) I will create the code which reads the whole file and every paragraph, I will start the next input, when some qualities of the text is changed, I will track these changes.
2) After doing that, I will simply use an English translater through the google Translater or DeepL(i am not sure yet) and translate all the stuff. Then I will copy the translation and pull it down into a translated, new file. 
3) That was all.
